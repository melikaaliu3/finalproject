Coffee Shop: Cafe is a WordPress theme integrated with WooCommerce and is very suitable for cafe or coffee shop websites. The theme has a modern design and a variety of layouts to choose from. 

All the settings are customizable, so you can change or even hide any part of the site. For example, if you don’t need to display the top bar/header, then no problem, just go to the Top Header settings page and disable the section (by the way, you can hide any social media icon or phone/email/address). 

WordPress Coffee Shop: Cafe theme allows you to have full control over the design of your site. The main header has two styles, from which you can choose the one you like. In the main header, all elements, from the logo color to the button style, are also customizable. The premium version comes with even more options, such as animations, layout sizes, preloader, and more. 

The single pages and posts also have different options: you can display the sidebar on the left or right, or hide it. You can also change the colors of the page/post title, banner texts and links, and other styles. The theme also has a built-in breadcrumbs option, and this will help you improve the SEO of your pages. The comment box and reply button are also customizable.

As we have already mentioned WordPress Coffee Shop: Cafe theme  is fully integrated with WooCommerce, which means that there are many options that allow you to change the entire design of the store pages. You can change almost everything, from the styles of the primary button to the text and background colors. There are also some WooCommerce features that will definitely increase the functionality of the store pages. For example, you can add a beautifully designed search bar with a list of categories or add a Sales section for the custom homepage. Other sections available for the custom homepage are Call to Action, WooCommerce products, Achievements, Advantages, Services, and Latest Posts.

The Coffee Shop: Cafe theme footer also comes with six different layouts and five beautifully designed themes (it should be noted that one footer theme is available in the free version, while four other footer themes are included in the premium version).

All these features will give you the opportunity to easily create a beautiful coffee shop or cafe website.
